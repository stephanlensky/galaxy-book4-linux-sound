## Update: As of 12/6/25 all bounties have been claimed! Please see the updated [README.md](./README.md) for details on the final patch.

# Pledge Terms

**For complete Linux speaker support on Samsung Galaxy Book4 Pro 360 (NP960QGK)**

- $500 USD pledge by @stephanlensky (me)

To claim this pledge, you must provide a solution that I can reproduce on my own laptop and proof that you have submitted the patch upstream so that others can benefit from it as well. You do **not** need to wait for upstream patches to be merged before collecting the pledge.

PayPal is preferred for payment, but we can also discuss IAT or other payment methods if you prefer. **Please do not post personal details for payment on GitHub. Contact privately in Discord or over email instead.**

## BountyHub pledge

**In addition to the above pledge**, if you are successfully able to close [thesofproject/linux#5002](https://github.com/thesofproject/linux/issues/5002), you will be eligible for a [$100 USD bounty on BountyHub](https://www.bountyhub.dev/bounty/view/b1ccd1f8-9d97-4cf4-8b86-2250fccd0dab).

I have placed the bulk of my pledge outside of BountyHub due to concerns about tying the payout too closely with closure of this specific SOF GitHub issue.
